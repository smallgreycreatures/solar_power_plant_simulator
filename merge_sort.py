	"""Sorting algorithm written with inspiration from http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/SortSearch/TheMergeSort.html
	Takes two lists with numbers as input arguments where the first list is sorted in decreasing order. 
	The second list just moves the elements on the same index i as in list 1 to the same index j in the 
	sorted list, it hence mimics the operations of the first list. The algorithm is a recursive divide 
	and conquer algorithm that splits lists into one element lists and then merge those lists. 
	During the merge the lists are sorted which enables a time complexity of O(nlogn).

	IMPORTANT: The algorithm demands that the two lists has the same len, else it throws an exception."""
