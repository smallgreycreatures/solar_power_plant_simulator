# Solar Power Plant Simulator
##Challenges:
If this program were written for a command line interface it would almost write itself. Estimated time spent on the actual calculation methods will be around one working day. The challenge for this application instead lies in providing usability. 
In order to provide usability a Graphical User Interface(GUI) will be provided. Writing such can be painstakin, however for this project the utilization of open source libraries will minimize the work and hence the cost.

The amount of time put into this project will be low and the program will be held simple which makes it easy to maintain. It will be written in a general way which will enable future extensions to be included easily.

##Use Cases:
Tom wants to see how much energy a solar power plant of the size 200m^2 outside of Stockholm would generate. Tom starts the program, chooses to simulate a solar power plant and inputs the latitude of Stockholm in a text box. He also inputs the power plants area and the material constant in simliar textboxes. The program responds with a dialog window which asks if Tom want to see the data as a bar chart, a table or save the data to a file. Tom chooses to save the data in a file and then quits the program through pressing the x button in the corner. He later visualizes the data in MatLab and compares it with data generated from other sessions.

Linda wants to see how the energy production for a solar plant outside of Tokyo would vary during a years time. She starts the program and choose to simulate a solar power plant. She inputs the material constans, the area of the cells and the latitude of Tokyo in the text boxes. The program reponds with a dialog window which asks if she wants to see the data as a bar chart, in a table or save it to a file. Linda chooses to see the data as a diagram. A bar chart is presented and Linda sees that during March the production is very low outside of Tokyo. She has to investigate why and therefore quits the program through a keyboard command.

##Program flow and data flow
The program starts in the ```main_menu()``` function. The user calls either ```calculate_solar_power()``` or ```calculate_wind_power()``` where a solar or wind power plant object with class variables as input to their constructors are created. If the user created a solar power plant latitudes are collected from the user and for each latitude the solar power plants function energy_calculator(latitude) is called. This function iterates over all days of a year and calls the functions solar_energy_calculator, mean_value_calculator and standard_deviation_calculator. A tuple is returned to the main calculate_solar_power function and depending on the user save_to_file(), generate_bar_chart() or generate_table() is called. Pressing the x-button in the left corner calls the quit() function which exits the program.
