# Solar Power Plant Simulator
##Challenges:
If this program were written for a command line interface it would almost write itself. Estimated time spent on the actual calculation methods will be around one working day. The challenge for this application rather lies in providing usability. 
In order to provide usability a Graphical User Interface(GUI) will be procided. Writing such can be painstaking but for this project off the shelf open source libraries can be utilized, minmizing work and cost. 

The amount of time put into this project will be low and the program will be held simple which makes it easy to maintain.
##Use Cases:
