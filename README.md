# Solar Power Plant Simulator
##Challenges:
If this program were written for a command line interface it would almost write itself. Estimated time spent on the actual calculation methods will be around one working day. The challenge for this application instead lies in providing usability. 
In order to provide usability a Graphical User Interface(GUI) will be provided in order to create a good overview over the data. Writing such can be painstaking, however for this project the utilization of open source libraries will minimize the work and hence the cost.

The amount of time put into this project will be low and the program will be held simple which makes it easy to maintain. It will be written in a general way which will enable future extensions to be included easily.

##Use Cases:
Tom wants to see how much energy a solar power plant of the size 200m^2 outside of Stockholm would generate. Tom starts the program, chooses to simulate a solar power plant and inputs the latitude of Stockholm in the console. He also inputs the power plants area and the material constant. The program responds and asks if Tom want to see the data as a bar chart, a table or save the data to a file. Tom chooses to save the data in a file and then quits the program. He later visualizes the data in MatLab and compares it with data generated from other sessions.

Linda wants to see how the energy production for a solar plant outside of Tokyo would vary during a years time. She starts the program and choose to simulate a solar power plant. She inputs the material constans, the area of the cells and the latitude of Tokyo in the terminal. The program reponds and asks if she wants to see the data as a bar chart, in a table or save it to a file. Linda chooses to see the data as a bar chart. A bar chart is presented and Linda sees that during March the production is very low. She has to investigate why and therefore quits the program.

##Program flow and data flow
The program starts in the ```main_menu()``` function where the wind_power_plant or solar_power_plant object is created. This object is sent to ```power_calculation(power_plant)``` where the objects ```calculate_energy()``` is called. This returns a data dictionary containing one element for wind power and n for solar where n is the number of latitudes. Each element in the dictionary contains a list of all days, for each day there is a tuple containing all useful information. Depending on which objects method is called different help methods are called to calculate how much sun or wind power is collected. If the user choose to diplay the data as a bar graph or in a table the function ```energy_produced_per_month(power_plant, energy_production_list)``` is called which calls  ```calculate_mean_value(energy_production_list)``` and ```calculate_standard_deviation(energy_production_list)``` and produces a tuple of (max, min, mean, standard deviaton) lists for each month. A bar graph or table is then created through the calling of ```display_bar_graph(energy_tuple)```or ```display_table(energy_tuple)```. If the user chooses save file the function ```save_file(power_plant_dict, power_plant, file_name)``` is called which saves a file with the data for each day in a file with the name file_name.
